 * Abstract Partial contorller class - empty now, but may expand. Idea is that

 * multiple partials on a single page, or a single "partial" used on different
 * pages - each partial view should have a controlleer method to handle it
 * To change this template file, choose Tools | Templates
 * and open the template in the editor.
