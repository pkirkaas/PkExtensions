  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Often you want to create a number of nearly identical, consistent DOM
    Nodes, which only differ in content. These packages not only make it
    easier and much faster, they help ensure a consistent look and feel on
    the page and across the site.
  <p>A typical case what I call a "Wrapped Set". An input or value element, 
    each wrapped in its own wrapping div/el, to make it easier to customize
    the fomatting/placement of the inputs & labels themselves, and then wrap
    the paired label/value elements in a unifying wrapper that keeps them together
    and allows them to be position & configured as set.

  <p>This is particularly useful in a form with multiple inputs, which should
    all be in the same format, just different data/labels. 

  <p>I have two broad catagories of these techniques - the first category is 
    packaging HTML information to display, like the non-editable output of user
    info when viewing a User Profile.

  <p>The second category is more complex; it behaves similarly, but wraps
    editable HTML Form/Data inputs.
