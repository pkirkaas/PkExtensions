<h1>What are PkExtensions?</h1>
<p>PkExtensions consist of multiple components, some very Laravel specific, others more generally applicable with PHP/JavaScript/CSS.

<p>The guiding principal is to provide a lot of reusable functionality for things developers do all the time - so you don't have to re-implement similar functionality every time. For example, enhanced form inputs (like, multi-select check boxes), bound by specific CSS class names to JavaScript/jQuery event handlers. Which support binding complex, nested, one to many to many forms with hidden templates and deletable data sets - so almost the only code you need to write to implement complex form to abstract DB data structures are the PHP/HTML templates. 

<h2>What do PkExtensions consist of?</h2>
<p>They consist of:
<ul>
<li><b>Laravel Extensions</b>: Classes that extend existing Laravel Classes, like PkModel, PkController, etc.
<li><b>New Utility Classes</b>: Stand-alone classes that I find really useful, that don't depend on Laravel - my favorite is "PartialSet" - an extension of ArrayObject that can contain almost anything and implements <tt>__toString()</tt> so you can just print / echo it out.

<li><b>Supporting PHP libraries</b>: PHP functions I find really useful. There can be some naming conflicts with other libraries.

<li><b>Supporting JavaScript, jQuery, CSS and SCSS Libraries</b>: I do lots of things where PHP and JS have to co-operate. These libraries help in a very generic way - like automatically building dialog boxes from PHP, just based on CSS class names and 'data-xxx' attribute names and values. Assumes jQuery & jQuery UI.

</li><b>Artisan helper scripts</b>: Just a couple of commands to:
  <ul>
    <li>Generate migration files from PkModel class definitions
    <li>Clear all caches, autoloads, everything in a single command
  </ul>
</ul>


<h2>What is the current status/version?</h2>
<p>Very much Alpha -  continually evolving, quite a bit of commented out code and experiments - but what works works pretty well and hopefully could be very useful to other developers. 

<p>See below for highlights of some of the more interesting features.

<h1>Extensions to existing Laravel Classes</h1>

<h2>PkModel</h2>
<p>This extends Eloquent Model and fills in what seemed to be some very obvious gaps.

<h3>public function saveRelations(Array $array = [])</h3>
<p>For one-to-many Objects, takes the multi-dimensional array of data and updates the Model instance and all its possessions/collections.

<p>For example, if you have:
<pre>
Class Cart extends PkModel {
  static $table_field_defs = [
      'id'=> 'increments',
      'cart_name'=>'string',
      'owner_id' => 'integer'
    ];

    public function items() {
      return hasMany('Models\\Item');
    }
  static $load_relations [ #Tells the class what one-to-many relationships it has
    'items' => 'Models\\Item',
    ];

    #...
}
</pre>
<p>... and ...
<pre>
Class Item extends PkModel {
  static $table_field_defs = [
      'id'=> 'increments',
      'item_name'=>'string',
      'cart_id' => 'integer'
      'price' => 'integer',
    ];
  #...
}
</pre>

<p>If you have an array of data representing the cart and its items, like:
<pre>
$data = [
  'id'=>7, #The cart ID - ignored because we know the cart
  'cart_name' => 'Happy Cart'
  'items' => [
      [
        'id'=>234, 
        'item_name'=>'Fishing Line',
        'cart_id' => 7, #Again ignored, we still know the cart
        'price' => 5,
      ],
      [
        #No item ID - this is new!
        'item_name'=>'Reel',
        'cart_id' => 7, #Again ignored, we still know the cart
        'price' => 22,
      ],
    ],
  ];
</pre>

<p>If you call:
<pre>
$myCart->updateRelations($data);
</pre>

<p>This method will:
<ul>
  <li>Update any of the changed cart fields to the values of the corresponding array keys - like 'cart_name'
  <li>Any key field in the data array that's not an attribute of $myCart is ignored (<tt>_token</tt>, for example.
  <li>Any attribute name that's part of the Cart definition but absent as a key in the data array is ignored.
  <li>Any Cart attribute name that is present as a key in the data array with a value of null is reset/nulled in the <tt>$myCart->$attributeName = null</tt>
  <li>When we get to a $key that is not an attribute but a key in the model's <tt>static $load_relations[]</tt> array, ('items'), iterate through any "relation" value arrays (items) and:
  <ul>
    <li>If the 'items' key doesn't exist, don't do anything to the cart's items.
    <li>If the 'items' key exists but has a value of null, empty string or [], delete all 'Item' Model/instances with <tt>'cart_id'==7</tt> (This cart has been emptied)
    <li>If the 'item' key value is an indexed array of associative arrays, go through and:
      <ul>
        <li>For any item data arrays that don't have an 'id' key - this is a new item added to the cart - create it with the associated data and 'cart_id'
        <li>If an item data array has an id, instantiate the corresponding 'Item' model/object, and if any of it's attributes are different from the corresponding attribute in the item value array, update it.
        <li>If any item id's from the cart's original collection are missing from the arrays of items data, they have been removed and are deleted from the DB and the Cart.
    </ul>
    <li>This is recursive, so if the "Item" model definition has collections/one-to-many relationships of its own, these are processed and persisted as well.
    </ul>
  </ul>

<p>What is the value of that? In conjunction with <tt>PkController</tt>, (described below), it makes processing / editing of complex forms that map to a single model object with an arbitrary number and nesting of one-to-many collections/relations a snap. The Controller method to fully edit a Cart form, with adding/deleting/modifying its items, etc is:

<pre>
Class CartController extends PkController {
  pubic function edit(Cart $cart) {
    $this->processSubmit($cart);
    return view('cart.edit', ['cart'=>$cart]);
  }
}
</pre>


<h3>public function saveM2MRelations(Array $array = [])</h3>
<p>Conceptually similar to <tt>saveRelations()</tt>, but for many-to-many relationships, through a pivot table. Say, a Person following a Person through the Follow pivot class.

<p>For this, we define a static array variable on the class like:
<pre>
Class Person extends PkModel {
  public static $load_many_to_many = [
      'friends' =>
      [
          'other_model' => 'Models\Person',
          'pivot_model' => 'Models\Friend',
             #OR
          'pivot_table' => 'friends',
          'my_key' => 'following_id', #Key for me (Follower) In the pivot table/model
          'other_key' => 'followed_id', #Key for who I'm following n the pivot table/model
      ],
  ];
</pre>

<p>Here we obviously don't edit or delete the other side of the relationship (Followed Person), we edit/create/delete entries in the Pivot Model/Table. 


<h3>DB Table Definition to generate Migration Files, etc</h3>
<p>It seems ridiculous that Eloquent Model classes don't know what attributes they have until they read the DB. Also, if you have a bunch of Migration files, it's hard to get an overview of all the DB table attributes by inspecting the code.

<h3>PkModel::$table_field_defs, PkModel::buildMigrationFieldDefs(), etc</h3>

<p>If you extend PkModel and include a static array member: $table_field_defs as follows (Example):
<pre>
class QProfile extends PkModel {
  public static $table_field_defs = [
      'id' => 'increments',
      'user_id' => ['type' => 'integer', 'methods' => 'index'],
      'viewableby_id' => ['type' => 'integer', 'methods' => ['default' => 10]],
      'privatedescription' => ['type' => 'string', 'methods' => 'nullable'],
      'publicdescription' => ['type' => 'string', 'methods' => 'nullable'],
      'name' => ['type' => 'string', 'methods' => 'nullable'],
      'location' => ['type' => 'string', 'methods' => 'nullable'],
      'searchable' => ['type' => 'boolean', 'methods' => ['default' => false]],
      'about' => ['type' => 'text', 'methods' => 'nullable'],
  ];
  #...
}
</pre>

<p>You can generate Migration files by running:
<pre>
php artisan make:migration QProfile
</pre>

<p>This will create the initial migration file to create the table <tt>q_profiles</tt>, and if you change/add/remove the Model field definitions in <tt>static $table_field_defs</tt>, the <tt>artisan make:migration QProfile</tt> command will do a reasonable job of creating the Migration Update scripts - though you might have to modify them by hand for complicated changes.

<h3>static::getStaticAttributeNames()</h3>
<p>Returns all the DB field names from the underlying table.

<h1>Eliminate 80% of the JavaScript you write to manage Dialogs, AJAX calls, handle forms, etc.</h1>
<p>You've already written almost the same code dozens of times with just minor variations. Just follow a few conventions with CSS class names and <tt>data-XXX</tt> attributes in your HTML, and it's all done.  If you use Laravel, <tt>PkFormBuilder</tt> extends Laravel Collective <tt>FormBuilder</tt> with methods to create the HTML components that work with the jQuery libraries. 

<h2>AJAX handling on click</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Create a DOM node you want to trigger / process the AJAX</b>: Could be just a button or link, or a complex nested collection of HTML elements. Add an attribute called <tt>data-pk-ajax-element</tt>. It doesn't need a value, jQuery will attach to it. No problem if you have many unrelated AJAX handler components on the same page.

  <p>If you are using Laravel, <tt>PkForm::ajaxElement($options)</tt> builds the HTML component for you.

  <li><b>Add a few more <tt>data-XXX</tt> attributes</b>:
    <ul>
      <li><tt>data-ajax-url</tt>: The URL for the AJAX call (the only other required attribute - the rest are optional)
      <li><tt>data-ajax-params</tt>: An encoded query string of parameters and values. You don't have to encode them, though. Just set <tt>$options['params'] =  ['param1'=>$val1, 'param1'=>$val2, ...]</tt> and leave it to <tt>PkForm::ajaxElement()</tt>.
      <li>Specify the other behavior you want in the $options values. What you want to do with the AJAX response, etc.
      <li>See the documented source codes for all the details and options.
    </ul>

    <li><tt>$('body').on('click', '[data-pk-ajax-element]', function (event) {...</tt> attaches to every element on the page with the 'data-pk-ajax-element' attribute, and submits the AJAX call based on the attributes defined in the target element.
    <li>The event handler also processes the AJAX result based on the DOM element attributes.
  </ul>

<h2>jQuery UI Dialogs</h2>
  <p>A typical dialog process involves a user clicking on something, which pops up a dialog to take some action.
  <ul>
    <li><b>On all elements the user clicks to initiate a dialog</b>: Add the CSS class <tt>js-dialog-button</tt>. The JS event handler will attach to that/them.
    <li><b>Add the attribute <tt>data-dialog</tt></b>: to each, set the value to name of the hidden dialog template the click should activate.
    <li><b>Create the dialog template(s)</b>: Assign them each the CSS class <tt>js-dialog-content</tt>. The included CSS sets <tt>display: none;<tt>. 
    <li><b>To each template, add the attribute <tt>data-dialog</tt></b>: Set it to the value of the corresponding attribute in the clickable element that should launch the dialog.
    <li><b>But Wait!</b>: Maybe you have 50 identical buttons on a page, that should pop up the same dialog, only with some different parameters - like a table of users, each with an "Edit" button to bring up a "User Edit" form. But different <tt>user_id</tt>. So each button can have several <tt>data-param</tt> attributes, with value of the corresponding user_id or whatever. The JS event handler substitutes the value from the button to the popped up dialog form. No extra JS required.
  </ul>

<h2>Mapping one->many ORM objects to DB tables and HTML forms for edit/create/delete - with almost no code</h2>









<h1>More Features/Extensions</h1>

<h2>PkSearchModel</h2>
<p>Supports building persistent complex user created searches/queries.

<p>PkSearchModel extends PkModel and works with PkController and <tt>BuildQueryTrait</b> to build, execute and persist complex user created searches. Like for a dating site use case:

<p><tt>Find all <b>women</b> WHERE (<b>age BETWEEN 27, 45</b>) AND <b>Zodiac Sign in one of ('aries', 'gemini', 'capricorn')</b> AND  <b>religion = "don't care"</b></tt>

<p>The abstract class PkSearchModel extends <b>PkModel</b> and uses <b>BuildQueryTrait</b>

<p>Any Controller that wants to manage searches should also use <b>BuildQueryTrait</b>

<p>For example, to create a search for Person objects, first define the Person model/class :
<pre>
class Person extends PkModel {
  public static $table_field_defs = [
    'id' => 'increments',
    'name' => 'string',
    'age' => 'integer',
    'religion_id' => 'integer', #Assumes reference map ID's => "Religion" strings
    'height' => 'integer',
    'zip' => 'integer',
    #...
  ];
  #...
}
</pre>

<p>Note the static array <tt>$table_field_defs</tt>

<p>A QueryModel to save searches for a Person would look like:
<pre>
Class PersonSearch extends PkSearchModel {
  use PersonSearchTrait; #Trait because also used in PersonController::search() action
  public $targetModel = Person::class; #The model to perform the search on
  public static $table_field_defs = [
    'id' => 'increments',

    #Simple scalar comparison - greater than, less than, etc.
    'age_val' => 'integer', #What age is the comparison against?
    'age_crit' => 'string', #What is the criterion? Greater than age_val? Less than?

    # Pick multiple acceptable values
    'religion_id_val' => 'string', #JSON encoded array of acceptable values
    'religion_id_crit' => 'string', #IN? NOT IN?

     #A Range / 'BETWEEN' query:
    'height_crit' => 'string', #  'BETWEEN' or '0'/Don't Care
    'height_minval' => 'integer',
    'height_maxval' => 'integer',

    #Uses a custom method to calculate "within X Miles of ZIP"
    'withinzip_val' => 'integer',
    'withinzip_crit' => 'string', 
    #...
}
</pre>
